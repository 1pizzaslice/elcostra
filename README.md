# Elcostra - The Ultimate Members List (Because Why Not?)

Welcome to **Elcostra**, the most exciting members list you never knew you needed! 🤩 Yes, it's just a fancy way to display a bunch of JSON files. Hold onto your hats, folks, because we're diving into the thrilling world of member information!

## Features

- A **stunning** black-and-white aesthetic that screams "minimalism" louder than a hipster in a coffee shop. ☕️
- Interactive member cards that give you all the important details, because clearly, you can't remember names, branches, or GitHub IDs.
- A joke-fetching feature from the *Gemini API* that'll surely make you chuckle—if you're into that sort of thing. 😂

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. If you don’t, good luck!
- A web browser (You know, those things you use to procrastinate?).
- An API key from the *Gemini API*—because who doesn’t love sharing keys?

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/euclidstellar/elcostra.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd elcostra
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser. If you have a favorite, that is.

## Usage

Just add your details in JSON format to the `members` folder, and voilà! You're now a part of something *big*. To view the cards, hover over them for more than 5 seconds and brace yourself for a tech joke. If you're feeling adventurous, click on the GitHub ID and see where it takes you. Spoiler: it's probably GitHub.
